# Nokia 5110 Temperature Logger
An **Arduino** based project that uses **Nokia 5110 screen as display** and **DS18B20** temperature sensor. Please read the whole text.

## How It Works ?
At start you set log interval (min: 0, max: 140) as minutes and press "OK" button to start the process.
**Graph is 72 pixels wide. If you log every one minute it takes 72 minutes to finish. For an example if you want to log the temperature of next 6 hours you have to set the interval to 5 minutes. 72*5 = 360 minutes, 360/60 = 6 hours. So the formula of the total time is : `logging interval * 72 = total minutes`, `total minutes / 60 = total hours`**
When it reaches %100, press "OK" button again to restart logging.

## Notes
This method doesn't use any SD card or EEPROM to save the logs so everytime you reset MCU you lose the data.
If you want to stop logging in the middle of the process press "reset" button on the Arduino.

## Materials Used :
- Any **ATmega328** based Arduino board such as Uno/Nano/Pro Mini
- Cheap Chinese Nokia 5110 display ( **Red or Blue and must be 5v tolerant** )
- **DS18b20** digital temperature sensor

## Libraries Used :
- LCD5110_Graph.h by **Henning Karlsen**
- Wire.h
- OneWire.h
